   <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This document details the game Card Capsules, which is a 2D side scrolling platformer puzzle game made with the Wolfie2D engine.
The core gameplay loop will focus on placing objects to help traverse an inhospitable alien planet.
This game employs use of a physics engine, AI, collision detection, memory management, and especially precise time control.
</p>

   <h1>Technology</h1>

<p>
Card Capsules is a game created for the Windows platform using the Wolfie2D game engine.
</p>

   <h1>Backstory</h1>

<p>
After a terraforming operation went awry due to a space pirate assault, our protaganist must crash land on the inhospitable world that they
were trying to rebuild. The player's newfound objective is to reach the wreckage of their ship and to repair it with the card capsules that
they find from the remnants that scattered the planet when the ship crash landed.
</p>
   <h1>Objective</h1>

<p>
The player must progress through each platforming puzzle in a level to recover pieces of their destroyed spaceship. Once they have each part
and reach the wreckage, they can repair their ship and escape the planet to safety.
</p>

   <h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>The player will travel through the level and collect cards along the way to help them traverse through traps and enemies. These cards are physical
objects that can be placed in the game world. Whilst card placement is occurring, time will be slowed down to assist the player in their decision making. This will affect animations, sound, and moving objects.<br></br>
The Cards that the player can receive are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Floating block: A block that floats</li>
  <li>Spring: An object that gives the player momentum in the direction it is facing</li>
  <li>Circular Rock: A rock that can roll down hills, dealing massive damage if it collides with an enemy</li>
</ul>
<p>
Cards are distributed to the player based on the level. They will sometimes be provided with cards at the beginning of the level. Cards may also be found scattered throughout the level itself, or as a reward from defeating enemies.
<br></br>
While the player is placing a card, the in-game screen will be overlaid with a grid. This is a helpful tool for the player to place their card in the correct location.
<br></br>
There are also two regions currently planned, spanning multiple levels. They are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>A lava region where hot floors threaten to kill the player instead of the usual spikes. The lava will instantly kill the player if they touch it. There will additionally be
	creatures made of lava, who will also kill the player if the player gets hit.
</li>
  <li>An arctic region which contains ice blocks for the player and enemies to slide across, and destructable terrain that the player must carefully progress through. </li>
</ul>
